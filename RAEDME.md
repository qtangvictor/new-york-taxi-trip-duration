# New York taxi trip duration project
This project is to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. The primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables. The input dataset is too large to update. It can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration. The code to process the data is shown in jupyter notebook.
